    "First, think about an arrow inside a coordinate system, like the **xy-plane**, with its tail sitting at the origin. This is a bit different from the physics perspective, where a vector can sit anywhere in space. In linear algebra, it's almost always the case that your vector will be rooted at the origin. Then, once you understand a new concept in the context of arrows in space, we'll translate it over the [list of numbers point of view](#the-computer-science-students-perspective) by considering the coordinates of the vector.\n",

    "1. **The first number** tells you how far to walk along the x-axis (positive #'s indicating rightward motion, negative #'s indicating leftward motion)\n",
    "2. **The second number** tells you how far to walk *parallel* to the y-axis (positive #'s indicating upward motion, negative #'s indicating downward motion)\n",
